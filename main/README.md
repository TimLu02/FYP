# FYP
## Active 18 file hosts the code of the Unet model with cross entropy as the loss function and groupnorm as the normalization layer
## Active 20 file hosts the code of the Unet model with dice loss as the loss function and batchnorm2d as the normalization layer
## Active 21 file hosts the code of the Unet model with dice loss and ReLU as activation function 
## Active 22 file hosts the Unet model with dice loss function as well as different groupnorm parameters. It currently hosts the best results.
## Active 23 file hosts the Unet Model with dice function, and changed the order of normalization layer in parts of the Unet Model.
## baseline_1 and baseline_2 files use the age features from the survival data to generate regression and classification prediction, and their performances will serve as the base line for prediction performance evaluation.
## Compute_mask_feature_selection... file uses pyradiomic package to conduct feature extraction using the results generated by the best model from Active 22
## Prediction_computed_mask file conducts feature selection and generates predictions
